# About
* This application provides Japanese words e-learning service. This is made for my Laravel practice.
* Note: Originally I was making this app as a training of a company that I've joined as a internship. (I've wrote all the code by myself, but thanksfully two senior employees did code review and testing.) After my internship was finished, I copied the original repository to this one (not using "fork" in case that they'll delete original one). I started this repository at July 3, 2019 and fixed minor things. 
* Original repository: https://github.com/framgia/fph_fels_laravel_tomokinagata
